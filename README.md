# Direct Feedback Alignment

Experiments with Direct Feedback Alignment (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01596) and comparison to Backpropagation.

## Contents

Small DNN framework with:
 - conv-, fully-connected-, dropout- and max-pool-layers
 - implementation of backward pass with dfa and backpropagation
 - customizable loss-function and optimizers (e.g. gd, momentum)
 
Reproducible experiments and comparisons

## Installation

```
python setup.py
```
